                                "Along with this I was given training on the other departments and teams as well including NexOne Legacy, Office & QA. " +
                                "Leagcy also used C# and Office used Oracle APEX, a technology that was totally new to me.",
            INTERNSHIP_LEARNING: "Throughout my time at the company I primarily dealt with bug fixes and improvements to the products as they were all released and established for some time and contain legacy code. " +
                                "I was trained on how to coordinate my tickets on Jira, including documenting work and working through the production pipeline, speeding up database queries by using LINQ methods like AsNoTracking and Skip/Take, and communicating and discussing effective and surgical changes to solve issues by creating code that fixes bugs and easy to maintain.",
            INTERNSHIP_UNIQUE: "A unique aspect of the company was the inclusion of a Customer Relations team to give end users training on the products and take in support calls. " +
                                "This added a more human element to the company through an open phone line whereby I would occasionally have to quickly diagnose a problem and determine if a code fix was needed. " +
                                "It was a unique challenge as it put pressure on balancing tickets and communicating with the teams.",
            INTERNSHIP_CONCLUSION: "Overall I feel as if I learned a great deal from the teams on code optimization, daily operations, communication in teams and multi-tasking tickets that I’ve already incorporated into my own personal work and projects!"
